<p>
  This is a test software, to see how to work in AngularJS4.
  There are these features
  Search, which just hits a backend algorithm in typescript and a test mock API
  pythsearch, which would hit a backend REST API in python, which would supply data to the client
  Mongosearch which would be a open ended search
  There is a spawner in one of the folders which is basically a webscapper using pyth-beautifulsoup
